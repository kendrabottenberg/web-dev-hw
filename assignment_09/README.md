The different selector types determine what style is going to affect what element. In a universal type all elements are effected. For example if i set a font all of the words will be set to that font. With an element one i can narrow down what is selected. For example I can do one that only effects paragraph elements. Next is class and divs. This is another way of just narrowing down what gets styled. When writing the style you would match the class or div ID to the text you want it to change.
For my color pallet i just did red, blue, and green. I made the red and blue with a 250 level instead of 255 to make them a little lighter and on the green I added a .2 opacity for a little extra pazzaz.
My work cycle for this was hectic. I understand the basic ideas of this but I am really struggling on how to apply everything and make things go in the right place. I had to basically copy your example and then use my own values but this stuff really isn't making much sense to me. Im not a computer person. I'm not sure if you even read these but this is my last semester and if I dont pass this class I dont graduate and it is really stressing me out that I cant see how I'm doing. I'm going to email you today and I'm hoping i am doing alright in this class.
