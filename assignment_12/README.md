My imaginary client is a high school web designing teacher. They wanted an example of a web site that shows base level knowledge of HTML and CSS to show their students what a very average base level site looks like.
Display inline flows with the content on the page and ignores width rules. Display inline block is similar to display inline but it does not ignore width and vertical rules. Block is when it doesn't flow with the things already on the page and makes room for itself.
For my work cycle I split it over a couple days. I knew this assignment was going to be much longer than the others since it is an entire website so I did HTML stuff one day and the others I spent messing around with CSS to get it to look nice. It didn't end up looking as nice as I had hoped but I tried to use all the different types of styling techniques and actually figured out a little how to do the divs and ids.
