I learned how to better organize certain elements and fix some weird formatting that I did.
I found a color chart to use so that I could get more specific colors.
I spent a couple days setting this up, first by piecing together old assignments to get a basic outline and then filling it in with new information. I know we were supposed to show off some skill of ours but really the only impressive thing I can do is solve a rubix cube really fast and there's not much to put on a website about that. Also, I apologize for the use of the F word. Although unprofessional I felt it necessary to properly show how I feel about this organization after being chained to it for so long. Thank you for all of your help through the semester and teaching me how to do things like this. You are a great professor and I will highly recommend this class to my friends. I wish you the best and hope you're staying healthy.
