Fonts are all different depending on where you get them from. Some computers run on windows and others do not. Because of this certain computers have different fonts and styles. Certain fonts like the ones I used in my website are ones that every computer should be able to see. I didnt add any new ones because I didnt want there to be fonts that you couldnt see.
The purpose of having fallback fonts is in case the readers cant see a certain font. There are many fonts that look similar and if you add a couple fallbacks that give the same intended effect there is a greater chance a persons computer will be able to read at least one of them.
For this assignemt I didn't actually have too hard of a time. I understood almost everything and I think I did it all correctly. I didnt add any external font sheets because I didnt want to complicate it and possibly mess up what I already had. The only thing that is still giving me trouble is organizig with divs and ids. It doesnt make that much sense to me and I like organizing it the other way a lot better.
