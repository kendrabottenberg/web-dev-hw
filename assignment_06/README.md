I do not understand what a form is basically at all. I tried my best to make one but honestly I really am lost on that one.
Different elements like text and select etc. are used on almost any website. You can login, subscribe to emails, give input on products, or leave contact info for certain companies to get back to you.
Like usual my work cycle was one of confusion. I am trying my best and hopefully at least most of it was done correctly.
