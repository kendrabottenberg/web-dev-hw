Divs are used to block together elements. Developers use them to clarify structure. ID's are within div's are the unique name used to describe each element. Classes are also within the div element but they are used to identify similar objects that can be grouped together. Spans are like div's because they also contain id's and classes but they have more to do with styling.
Alt text is used to describe exactly what an image is. It should be precise for those who are visually impaired.
