  <p>  Just like the 80s films
  We'll hook up in my back seat and let my best friend drive
  Just like the 80s films
  We'll hook up in my back seat and let my best friend drive

  She said, "How does it feel to be you?"
  I said, "It's alright, I really think I peaked in high school"
  She said, "That isn't possible, you are out of your mind
  Cause we never hooked up in high school"

  We just need a night like
  We just need a night like this, yeah
  Take me back to 9th grade
  Take me back to 9th grade shit, yeah

  Just like the 80s films
  We'll hook up in my back seat and let my best friend drive
  Just like the 80s films
  We'll hook up in my back seat and let my best friend drive

  She said, "How'd we end up in the parking lot in Smithtown?"
  The morning's on its way to sunrise
  She said, "The island is long, but life is short in this town
  I'm glad we got to redo the time"

  We just need a night like
  We just need a night like this, yeah
  Take me back to 9th grade
  Take me back to 9th grade shit, yeah
  And just like the 80s films
  We'll hook up in my back seat and let my best friend drive

  Just like the 80s films
  We'll hook up in my back seat and let my best friend drive
  Just like the 80s films
  We'll hook up in my back seat and let my best friend drive

  I can't let go and your lips feel retro
  You're my Breakfast Club
  You're my song from Cyndi Lauper
  No more missed times, we fly by street signs
  Let your hips rewind
  Take me back into the future, yeah

  Just like the 80s films
  We'll hook up in my back seat and let my best friend drive
  Just like the 80s films
  We'll hook up in my back seat and let my best friend drive </p>
