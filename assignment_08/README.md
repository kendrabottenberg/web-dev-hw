Learning how to use HTML has not been easy for me at all. I've really been struggling with some of the elements but I do think I learned how to re do some of the things I previously missed and that this website isn't too bad.
I am very nervous to start learning about styling. That's the part that has made the least sense to me out of everything so I'm hoping it wont be that bad.
For this project I split everything up into different days so I didn't get as frustrated with it. I also started using the internet to explain things a little more so I could better understand them and I think that helped me a lot with things like images.
