In a document there is usually one head element and one body element. The head element contains processing information and document metadata. The body contains the data that is rendered by the browser and displayed on the client's local computer.
Structural mark up makes the document structural pieces work like headings and lists. Sematic is more of a style feature to make words bold or emphasized.
