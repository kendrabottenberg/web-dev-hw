I went to Youtube.com in 2008 and it is insanely different. It's funny to think that I use to visit that site daily when it looked like that and I completely forgot how far it has come. It looks so low tech in comparison to now and the ease of use seems to be a lot lower due to less visuals.
I'll be honest, I never 100% know what i'm doing on GIT and it frustrates the living hell out of me. This class is a struggle for me.
